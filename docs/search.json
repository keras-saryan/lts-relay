It’s about the mythological character Salut Kote, and how she learned to respect her ancestors.\nOne day Salut Kote’s mother led her into the forest to gather blueberries. They saw a blueberry bush and started picking from it. Her mother stumbled and broke a beehive, and the bees swarmed out and attacked them. They ran away and managed to escape from the bees, but this made them drop all the blueberries. She asked her mother, “Why did we gather blueberries, anyway?” Her mother replied, “Don’t ask such questions! Gathering blueberries ties us to our ancestors!”\nSo they gathered blueberries again the next day, and many more times after that. Each time, the gathering reminded her of the bees… which reminded her of her ancestors."
