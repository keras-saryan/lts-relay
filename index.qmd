# ❓ About

This website showcases the results of the LTS Relay (<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">aka</span> The Relayening), a conlang relay involving members of the [LangTime Studio](https://www.youtube.com/@LangTimeStudio){target="_blank" title="Go to LangTime Studio on YouTube"} Discord server. However, as it was not signed off on by CEO Bib Larid(i)on, Esq., it does not constitute an officially-sanctioned LangTime Corp enterprise.

# 🗓 Participants and schedule

The table below shows the eight participants that took part in the relay, the languages used as well as the intended and actual schedule. A link to PDF copies of each torch document is also provided; these can also be viewed [below](#the-torches). Each participant was given a week to decipher and translate the text and craft their torch document; however, this relay took a very laid-back approach to the concept of deadlines.

# 👀 The unveiling

The results of the relay were revealed in a Google Meet call with all participants. This was recorded and later released publicly on [Let's Have a Bouba](https://www.youtube.com/@LetsHaveaBouba){target="_blank" title="Go to Let's Have a Bouba on YouTube"} on YouTube. The video can be viewed below, as can the slides used in the grand unveiling.

# 🔥 The torches

As well as being available for download [above](#participants-and-schedule), each torch document can be viewed in the tabs below. Some include an English translation, others not, but this can be seen for all languages in the video and slides [above](#the-unveiling) as well as on this page [below](#the-translation-trajectory). There is, of course, no second Yaatláw torch.

# 🔁 The translation trajectory

Since, let's face, what you're probably most interested in is how the text evolved over the course of the relay, the text and English translation at each stage of the relay are reproduced below to make your life that little bit easier.

Why are we still looking for berries?

A mother and daughter were out in the mountains looking for maqui berries. They see a tree with a lot of berries and stop to collect them. The mother accidentally stepped on a beehive, so bees flew out. They ran and hid until the bees went away, dropping their berries. They carried on looking for berries in the mountains. The daughter asked her mother, 'mum, why are we still looking for berries?ʼ. The mother replied 'be quiet my daughter! We are bonding and I still want berries.'

The above text is inspired by a story by Charlotte Coté (2022) of the Nuu-Chah-Nulth community of Tseshaht.

Why we still look for berries

A daughter and mother were looking for maqui berries in a cloud(y) forest. They saw a rich maqui tree, stopped, and picked them [the berries]. The mother fell over and crushed a beehive, and a swarm of bees appeared. They ran and hid themselves; the bees could not see them. Agh! They dropped the basket and berries!

The daughter screamed: "Mother! Why are we still looking for berries!?"

The mother answered: "Daughter, do not speak! We are becoming [better] friends."

The mother still needs berries.

The text above is a descendent of a story told (lit. made) by Charlotte Cotés. She told it in 2022; she is from Tseshaht and the Nuu-chah-nulth nation.

A daughter and her pale mother were searching for blackcurrants in the forest. They saw and stopped walking toward a blackcurrant tree that grew many berries and began gathering berries. The mother fell on and crushed a beehive, when suddenly many bees began arriving. They ran away and hid themselves and the bees could not see them. They could not hold all the berries and dropped the bowl of berries. The daughter asked her mom: "Why are we searching for berries, again?". The mother responded to her daughter: "Stop talking! We are building our family bond!". The mother still wants to collect berries.

The words written above are a story from the ancestors of Charlotte Cotés. It was told in 2022 in Tseshahtnat, a village of the Nuu-chah-nulth.

A girl and her pale mother searched for black berries in the forest. They saw a tree that had grown many berries and walked toward it, then began taking the berries. The mother fell and broke a beehive and many bees came. They ran and the hid, and they were not seen by the bees. They could not hold the berries and they fell from their hands.

The girl asked her mother, "Why are we looking for black berries once again?"

The mother replied to the girl, "You donʼt talk. We make a knot for the ancestors."

The mother wanted to gather black berries many times.

The words written are Salut Kote's ancestor's story. It is said that over 6862 people of Sesanat live in the Nechanat village.

This is a story told by the seven thousand or so Sesanat people living in the town of Nechanut. It's about the mythological character Salut Kote, and how she learned to respect her ancestors.

One day Salut Kote's mother led her into the forest to gather blueberries. They saw a blueberry bush and started picking from it. Her mother stumbled and broke a beehive, and the bees swarmed out and attacked them. They ran away and managed to escape from the bees, but this made them drop all the blueberries. She asked her mother, "Why did we gather blueberries, anyway?" Her mother replied, "Don't ask such questions! Gathering blueberries ties us to our ancestors!"

So they gathered blueberries again the next day, and many more times after that. Each time, the gathering reminded her of the bees... which reminded her of her ancestors.

Iʼm spinning a story from the many Tiranat people in the land of Nittjanuttju. Hear the story of Tarut Kutti, who was a great person in the far past, and who learned to respect her ancestor.

Her mother lead her to a forest to pick blueberries. They saw a bush that was heavy with blueberries, and started gathering. Her mother fell and accidentally broke a beehive. From this, the bees formed a cloud and, like a wave crashing over a ship, overwhelmed Tarut Kutti and her mother. The pair left the bees, and with their flight the gathered blueberries fell.

Tarut Kattu said to her mother, "Why do we pick blueberries?"

Her mother said to her, "Donʼt say that! We are bound to our ancestor by the blueberry picking!"

After this, they picked blueberries for many days. With the picking, Tarut Kattu was taught the story of the bees and the story of the ancestor.

Now I shall tell you a story from the Ḍiṛanaḍ people of Niidžanoodžo. Listen to the story of Ḍaṛoḍ Gooḍi, a strong person who lived there long ago and who was taught respect for his ancestors.

His mother led him to an orchard for the blue fruit harvest. They saw a plant which was laden with blue fruit and enthusiastically began picking. His mother fell and broke a beehive. Because of this, the bees formed a cloud which overwhelmed Ḍaṛoḍ Gooḍi and his mother. The two of them fled from the bees, quickly dropping the blue fruit which had been picked.

Ḍaṛoḍ Gooḍi asked his mother, "What do we pick blue fruit for?"

His mother replied, "Don’t say such a thing! It is through the blue fruit harvest that we are connected to our ancestors!"

After this, they picked blue fruit for many days. It is from the harvest that Ḍaṛoḍ Gooḍi was given the story of the bees and the story of the ancestors.

There once was a person who lived in this place long, long ago and who learned to respect their ancestors. I will tell their story. Listen to it!

The person's parent brought them into these woods so that they could gather blueberries. They saw a plant with many berries, so they very happily began to collect them.

The parent knocked down a beehive, causing the bees to emerge and swarm around them! The two quickly ran away from the bees, dropping the berries they had gathered.

The child asked, "Why do we gather blueberries?"

The parent responded, "Don't say that! By gathering blueberries, we are connected with our ancestors."

After this, the two gathered blueberries for many days.

Once upon a time there lived a person who belonged to a clan. Come listen to the story I will tell of how they learned to respect their people!

A parent went into the forest to collect blueberries with the person. They saw a blueberry bush and started collecting berries contentedly. The parent knocked down a hive that bees were living in. Because the bees came out and surrounded them, they dropped the blueberries and left running. The person asked the parent, 'why are we collecting blueberries?' The parent says 'don't say these words. We collect blueberries, connecting us with our ancestors.' They collected blueberries for many days.

I have told you the story of the person who learned about respecting the ancestors.

Why are we still looking for berries?

A mother and daughter were out in the mountains looking for maqui berries. They see a tree with a lot of berries and stop to collect them. The mother accidentally stepped on a beehive, so bees flew out. They ran and hid until the bees went away, dropping their berries. They carried on looking for berries in the mountains. The daughter asked her mother, 'mum, why are we still looking for berries?ʼ. The mother replied 'be quiet my daughter! We are bonding and I still want berries.'

The above text is inspired by a story by Charlotte Coté (2022) of the Nuu-Chah-Nulth community of Tseshaht.

Once upon a time there lived a person who belonged to a clan. Come listen to the story I will tell of how they learned to respect their people!

A parent went into the forest to collect blueberries with the person. They saw a blueberry bush and started collecting berries contentedly. The parent knocked down a hive that bees were living in. Because the bees came out and surrounded them, they dropped the blueberries and left running. The person asked the parent, 'why are we collecting blueberries?' The parent says 'don't say these words. We collect blueberries, connecting us with our ancestors.' They collected blueberries for many days.

I have told you the story of the person who learned about respecting the ancestors.

Finally, just for a bit of fun, the table and plots in the tabs below show how the length of the text and its English translation changed over the course of the relay in terms of number of both words and characters.[^3]

[^3]: All conlang texts use the romanisation as the basis for this with the exception of Sdefa for which the orthography is used and, additionally, characters and words are equated for Sdefa.
